# Jameson-Tools
In this project, I have customized a WordPress theme with multilingual support, AMP optimizations, advanced WooCommerce product displays, and custom tabs for specifications, videos, and documentation. Additional features include Genesis framework tweaks, cookie consent, GTIN fields, and geolocation-based content delivery.
